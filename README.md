# MMA 2018 Shiny Workshop
These documents were produced for a workshop offered to the MMA '18 Class. The goal to introduce students to the basics of Shiny. 

We'll begin by forking the repo, walking through the web scraper that's used to generate basic.csv

Then we will build a ui and server for the Shiny app and use it to investigate some drivers in Wrigley Field attendance.
