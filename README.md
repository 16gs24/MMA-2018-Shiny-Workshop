# MMA 2018 Shiny Workshop
These documents were produced for a workshop offered to the MMA '18 Class. 

The goals are:
- Introduce students to libraries  `shiny` and `shinydashboards`. Discuss the design behind them, and how the UI and server interact.
- Introduce web scraping. Walk through `ScrapingData.R` to pull Attendance data from Wrigley Field that is stored in `basic.csv`
- Develop a shiny app that utilizes a different data inputs to create different outputs to inspire students for personal projects. Begin with `Template.R` and finish with something resembling `TutorialContent.R`
- Review `AdvancedApp.R` that focuses on some tools of interest: the `plotly` library and some other UI options.
